<h2>Operator</h2>

<p>The <strong>Taxi Operator</strong> is a technical service provider connecting a taxi to the <strong>Taxi Exchange Point (TXP)</strong>. There are several main interactions between <strong>Operators</strong> and the <strong><abbr title="Taxi Exchange Point">TXP</abbr></strong>: declaring a taxi (including registering the vehicle, driver and license), updating its location and status, receiving a hail issued by a client for a taxi, querying and updating the status of the hail.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> in accordance with the Terms of Service, you are allowed to declare a taxi and update its location and status <em>only</em> within the context of the real-time journey of a real taxi driver: automation, replay and any other form of mass data gathering is expressly forbidden.</p>

<h3 id="vehicle_create">Registering a vehicle</h3>

<p>Registering a vehicle is done through a <code>POST</code> request to the <em>vehicles</em> API. The structure of the required <code>vehicle</code> object is described in the  reference documentation.</p>

<p>Calls to this API are idempotent: you can update a vehicle simply by submitting the updated <code>vehicle</code> object. If the <code>licence_plate</code> is different, a new vehicle will be created; if the <code>licence_plate</code> is unchanged, the vehicle will be updated.</p>

<h3 id="driver_create">Registering a driver</h3>

<p>Registering a driver is done through a <code>POST</code> request to the <em>drivers</em> API. The structure of the required <code>driver</code> object is described in the reference documentation.</p>

<p>Calls to this API are idempotent: you can update a driver simply by submitting the updated <code>driver</code> object. If the <code>department</code> or <code>professional_licence</code> is different, a new driver will be created; if the <code>department</code> and <code>professional_licence</code> are unchanged, the driver will be updated.</p>

<h3 id="ads_create">Registering a license (ADS)</h3>

<p>Registering a license (in French Autorisaton De Stationnement ADS) is done through a <code>POST</code> request to the <em>ads</em> API. The structure of the required <code>ads</code> object is described in the reference documentation.</p>

<p>Calls to this API are idempotent: you can update a license (ADS) simply by submitting the updated <code>ads</code> object. If the <code>insee</code> or <code>numero</code> is different, a new license (ADS) will be created; if the <code>insee</code> and <code>numero</code> are unchanged, the license (ADS) will be updated.</p>

<h3 id="taxi_create">Declaring a taxi</h3>

<p>Declaring a taxi is done through a <code>POST</code> request to the <em>taxis</em> API. The structure of the required <code>taxi</code> object is a minimalistic version of the one described in the reference documentation containing only the identifiers of the <code>vehicle</code>, <code>driver</code> and <code>ads</code> and the initial <code>status</code> of the taxi. The <code>vehicle</code>, <code>driver</code> and <code>ads</code> used to compose a <code>taxi</code> need to have been registered first through their respective API.</p>

<h5>Taxi declaration</h5>

<pre class="code">{
  "data": [
    {
      "vehicle": {
         "licence_plate": "WM-220-VP"
       },
      "driver": {
         "departement": "75",
         "professional_licence": "091402"
       },
      "ads": {
        "insee": "75056",
        "numero": "20997"
      },
      "status": "free"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

<p>If successful, the API returns the complete <code>taxi</code> object as described in the reference documentation, including the characteristics of the vehicle and most importantly the unique identifier <code>id</code> of the <code>taxi</code> that will be used for subsequent communications.</p>

<p>Calls to this API are idempotent: if you resubmit the same triplet of <code>vehicle</code>, <code>driver</code> and <code>ads</code>, the <code>taxi</code> returned will have the same <code>id</code>.</p>


<h3 id="taxi_location_update">Updating the location of a taxi</h3>

<p>The location of the taxi is updated through a UDP datagram sent to the geolocation server (<code>geoloc</code> subdomain of this server) on port 80.</p>

<p>The JSON payload of the UDP datagram should be as follows.</p>

<pre class="code">{
  "timestamp":"1430076493",
  "operator":"neotaxi",
  "taxi":"9cf0ebfa-dd37-45c4-8a80-60db584535d8",

<h3 id="taxi_update">Updating the status of a taxi</h3>

<p>In most cases, the status of the taxi is automaticaly set by the  <abbr title="Taxi Exchange Point">TXP</abbr> according to the status of a hail. Outside of the context of a hail, you still need to indicate if the taxi is <code>free</code> or <code>occupied</code> or <code>off</code>. This is done through a <code>PUT</code> request to the <em>/taxis/{taxi_id}/</em> API.</p>

<h3 id="taxi_get">Querying the status and time of last location update of a taxi</h3>

<p>In order to check that the updating of the status or location of the taxi worked properly, you can use a <code>GET</code> request to the <em>/taxis/{taxi_id}/</em> API.</p>

<p>Warning: The <code>GET</code> <em>/taxis/{taxi_id}/</em> API will return the <code>status</code> and the <code>last_update</code> but the <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> will be nulled (for privacy reasons).</p>

<p>Warning: in production, you should almost never need the <code>GET</code> <em>/taxis/{taxi_id}/</em> API. All necessary informations about taxis around a location are already in the response of the <code>GET</code> <em>/taxis</em> API and all necessary informations about the chosen taxi are already in the response of the <code>GET</code> <em>/hails/{hail_id}</em> API.
</p>

<h3 id="hail_receive">Receiving a hail</h3>

<p>In order to receive hails, <strong>operators</strong> need to implement an endpoint on their servers. The endpoint has to be able to receive <code>POST</code> requests from the <abbr title="Taxi Exchange Point">TXP</abbr>. This is the only endpoint that needs to be implemented on the <strong>operator</strong> side.</p>

<p>The <code>hail</code> JSON object which will be transmitted as the payload of the <code>POST</code> request is detailed in the reference documentation.</p>

<p>Accredited <strong>operators</strong> can enter the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of their <i>dev</i>, <i>test</i> and <i>prod</i> endpoints on the <a href="{{ url_for('profile.edit') }}">profile</a> page.</p>

<p>The endpoint should return one of the valid HTTP status code in the <code>2xx Success</code> range in case of success, and in the <code>4xx Client Error</code> or <code>5xx Server Error</code> in case of error. If the status code is in the  <code>2xx Success</code> range, the response payload can be a JSON <code>hail</code> object, in which case the hail will be updated on the  <abbr title="Taxi Exchange Point">TXP</abbr>. This response payload can for instance be used to transmit the <code>taxi_phone_number</code> to the  <abbr title="Taxi Exchange Point">TXP</abbr>.</p>

<p>After the hail has been acknowledged by the operator to the  <abbr title="Taxi Exchange Point">TXP</abbr>, it should be communicated by the operator to the taxi driver ASAP.</p>

 <h3 id="hail_get">Querying the status of a Hail</h3>

 <p> In order to keep track of the status of the hail, you can do a <code>GET</code> request to the  <em>/hails/{hail_id}/</em> API. The list of all possible statuses is available in the reference documentation.</p>


 <h3 id="hail_update">Updating a Hail</h3>

 <p>In order to finalise the transaction, the taxi has to acknowledge the hail. It is done through a <code>PUT</code> request to the <em>/hails/{hail_id}/</em> API.</p>

<p>The status of the hail has to be <code>received_by_taxi</code> before the taxi driver is asked to confirm the ride. If you don't send a PUT request with either the <code>accepted_by_taxi</code> or the <code>declined_by_taxi</code> status in the next 30 seconds, the   hail will automatically be updated to <code>timeout_taxi</code> and the whole transaction be considered cancelled. You do have to   check when you do a PUT with the status <code>accepted_by_taxi</code> that the status in the response is <code>accepted_by_taxi</code> (the taxi is arriving) and not <code>timeout_taxi</code> (your reconfirmation arrived too late, the whole transaction had to be canceled).</p>
